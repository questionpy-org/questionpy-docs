# Welcome to QuestionPy

The QuestionPy Software is the result of the correspondent QuestionPy Project realized at the TU Berlin innoCampus.

## Projectdescription
*translated from [original project descritpion in german](https://www.tu.berlin/innocampus/projekte/questionpy)*

<p style="text-align:justify">In e-assessments, students should be confronted with more competence-oriented and, if 
necessary, interactive questions in which not only solutions are entered, but also ways of solving the problem are 
queried. Students should also receive helpful feedback after entering answers in order to support their learning 
process and increase study success.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The Learning Management System (LMS) Moodle will be extended by a freely programmable 
question type. This will enable instructors to design completely new and individual question types in the Python 
programming language. The question types will contain the logic to generate the question and the input fields. They 
take the assessment, create the sample solution, generate hints/tips if necessary, and output a feedback text. 
Instructors should be able to develop and use their own subject-specific question type without the mandatory 
involvement of LMS administrators, who no longer need to install and maintain software for each instructor. There will 
be a support offer for all subject areas of the TU Berlin, according to whose requirements subject-related question 
types will be programmed.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The created question type consists of the Python source code, metadata, all dependencies 
and optionally additional arbitrary files (e.g. images). The code is executed in a secured environment (sandbox) 
where arbitrary access to files and network resources is prevented to minimize security risks. The files are bundled 
into an archive (question package) and can thus be uploaded to the LMS in a compact form and shared between instructors, 
preferably as Open Educational Resources (OER). The question types can define setting fields, making the questions 
parameterizable. A uniform interface is created between the LMS and the question type, which means that other LMSs can 
be supported and QuestionPy becomes an open exchange format. This will increase interoperability and enable the 
exchange of questions also with teachers from other universities.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The resulting software from the project will be released under an open license so that 
other educational institutions can also benefit from QuestionPy.</p>
